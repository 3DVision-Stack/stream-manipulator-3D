            Wrapping of pcl::VoxelGrid filter. Downsample point cloud data by
            overlapping a grid of voxels, with user specified dimensions.

            It creates  a 3D voxel grid  (think about a  voxel grid as a  set of
            tiny 3D  boxes in space) over  the input point  cloud data. Then, in
            each voxel (i.e., 3D box), all the points  present will be approximated
            (i.e., downsampled) with their centroid. This approach is  a bit slower
            than approximating them with the  center  of  the  voxel,  but it 
            represents  the  underlying  surface  more accurately.
